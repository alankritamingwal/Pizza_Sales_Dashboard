# Business Understanding

A Pizza Chain needed an executive-level business intelligence (BI) solution to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and analyze data from various sources.

I tried to answered some questions posed by Maven Analytics to be able to answer:

What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
What's our average order value?
How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? 
About the dataset: This dataset contains 1 tables in CSV format

The Orders table contains the date & time that all table orders were placed
The Order Details table contains the different pizzas served with each order in the Orders table, and their quantities
The Pizzas table contains the size and price for each distinct pizza in the Order Details table, as well as its broader pizza type
The Pizza Types table contains details on the pizza types in the Pizzas table, including their name as it appears on the menu, the category it falls under, and its list of ingredients
Problem Approach:

I connected and transformed raw data from Excel files and designed interactive reports and dashboards to complete the task.
I re-modelled the data relationship.
I created an executive KPI dashboard containing dynamic filtering options, high-level trending metrics, sales performance, order distribution, and trendings month over month, quarter over quarter.
